# Static Analysis

Static analysis is a technique used to evaluate the security of an application by examining its source code without executing it. 

In the context of Android applications, static analysis helps identify potential vulnerabilities, coding errors, and violations of secure coding practices by analyzing APK contents, Smali code, or decompiled Java code. 

Step:

### Extracting and Enumerating APK Files

- [Extract the APK](./APK%20Extraction.md)
- [Disassembling](./Disassembling%20the%20APK.md)
- [Enumerate](./Enumerations.md)
