## Attacking Wi-Fi Networks

The first thing to do when using tools in linux is to putting your adapter to monitor mode check the [Environment Setup](./Environment%20Setup.md)

### WEP Attacks
- With Client connected

    - [ARP Replay Attack](./Attacking%20Wi-Fi%20Networks/WEP/ARP%20Replay%20Attack.md)
    - [Bypassing Shared Key Authentication (WEP on Secured Network)](./Attacking%20Wi-Fi%20Networks/WEP/Bypassing%20Shared%20Key%20Authentication.md)
    - [Caffe-Latte Attack](./Attacking%20Wi-Fi%20Networks/WEP/Caffe-Latte%20Attack.md)

- Without Client connected
    - [Clientless WEP cracking](./Attacking%20Wi-Fi%20Networks/WEP/Clientless%20WEP%20cracking.md)
    
### WPA/WPA2 Attacks
- With Client connected
    - [Capture the Handshake](./Attacking%20Wi-Fi%20Networks/WPA%20and%20WPA2/Capture%20the%20Handshake.md)
