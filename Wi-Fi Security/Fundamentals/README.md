# Wireless Standards and Networks

**IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)** is a worldwide association dedicated to advancing technologies innovation

**IEEE 802.11** is the IEEE Working Group that develops and enhances standards related to WiFi technologies.

## Types of Wireless Networks

There are two main types of wireless networks architectures :

- Infrastructure Networks
- Ad-hoc Networks

### 1. Infrastructure Networks
A Basic Service Set (BSS) contains a Access Point (AP) and a set of wireless client stations (STAs). Every BSS has a unique formal identifier called **BSSID (the MAC address of the AP)**

> An informal name is also assigned to a BSS. It is called SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the one you usually see when connecting to a wireless network

Single BSS's can be combined to form groups of Access Point connected together. This configuration takes the name of `Entended Service Set (ESS)`

In such a configuration, multiple BSS's exist with a common SSID (now call ESSID) but unique BSSID

### 2. Ad-hoc Networks

This type of network does not need an existing infrastructure. All of the STAs directly communicate to each others, as there is not a central base. A set of stations connected like this is called **IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set)**
