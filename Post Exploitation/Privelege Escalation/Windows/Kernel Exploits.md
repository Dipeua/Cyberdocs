# Kernel Exploits

The [kernel](https://en.wikipedia/wiki/Kernel_(operating-system)) is a computer program that controls everything in the system, facilitates interactions betwen hardware and software components.

Exploiting a kernel vulnerability can result in execution as the 
SYSTEM user.

## Finding Kernel Exploits

Finding and using kernel exploits is usually a simple process:

- Enumerate Windows version / patch level (systeminfo).
- Find matching exploits (Google, ExploitDB, GitHub).
- Compile and run.

Beware though, as Kernel exploits can often be unstable and 
may be one-shot or cause a system crash.
