- `index.php` is the homepage of WordPress.

- `license.txt` contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.

- `wp-activate.php` is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.

- `wp-admin` folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard.
    
    The login page can be located at one of the following paths:

    - `/wp-admin/login.php`
    - `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`
    - `/login.php`
    - `/wp-login.php`

- `xmlrpc.php` is a file representing a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication has been replaced by the WordPress [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference).

- `wp-config.php` this file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database. This configuration file can also be used to activate _DEBUG_ mode, which can useful in troubleshooting.

- The `wp-content` folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored.  The subdirectory `uploads/` is usually where any files uploaded to the platform are stored


> These directories and files should be carefully enumerated as they may lead to contain sensitive data that could lead to remote code execution or exploitation of other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

- `wp-includes` contains everything except for the administrative components and the themes that belong to the website. This is the directory where core files are stored, such as certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets.


## User Roles
- `Administrator` 	This user has access to administrative features within the website. This includes adding and deleting users and posts, as well as editing source code.

- `Editor` 	An editor can publish and manage posts, including the posts of other users.

- `Author` 	Authors can publish and manage their own posts.

- `Contributor` 	These users can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.

- `Subscriber` 	These are normal users who can browse posts and edit their profiles.


> Gaining access as an administrator is usually needed to obtain code execution on the server. However, editors and authors might have access to certain vulnerable plugins that normal users do not.
